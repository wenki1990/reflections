How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
diff gave me results showing the difference between the two files.
I first saw the lines that were replaced in the new version. Then looked for typo in 
the new lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer 
in the long term?
It will by easier to understand what changes have been done.
It will also be a lot easier to switch back to preversion in case I want to.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Commiting Manually
Pros.
1.Content is saved only after completion of making a logical change.
Cons.
1.Sometimes we forget to commit a logical change

Commiting Automatically
Pros.
1.No need to think about saving
Cons.
1.File may get saved when the work is still incomplete

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files 
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
When a repository has multiple files, the file can be connected.So, commiting changes
in all the files at once will make them to work as required.Google Docs is mainly for
editin documents.So, even if each file is commited individually, there won't be any 
connection b/w each other.
 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lists the commits ids and timestamp
git diff shows the differences in files like addition,deletion when first commit id
and second commit ids are provided

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
since git log keeps track of all the commits and messages related to each commit, I can switch 
back to previous version using checkout if i find something went wrong after a commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To keep track of files for data science projects
