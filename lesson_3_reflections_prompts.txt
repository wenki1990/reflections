When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever I want to copy my entire local git repository to GitHub or when I
    want my local repository data and GitHub repository data to be in sync,
    I would like to create a remote repository of GitHub repository in my local
    repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Someone on the other side of the world can make changes to remote repository
    or it could be me. So, I don't want the changes to be automatically updated 
    into my local repo.I want to make sure what changes am I pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Cloning a git repository of one account on GitHub  to another account on GitHub.
	  I would use this if I find a repository on GitHub which serves the purpose I intended to.
	  So, it would be lot easier for me to directly use than to develop from scratch.
   Clone: Cloning is done to copy a git repository from GitHub to local computer.
	  This done if the files in the repository cannot be edited on GitHub.
   Branches: These are created on commits in scenarious like you want a different version 
	     or feature without disturbing the main working code.
	  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
