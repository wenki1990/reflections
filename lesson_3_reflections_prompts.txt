When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever I want to copy my entire local git repository to GitHub or when I
    want my local repository data and GitHub repository data to be in sync,
    I would like to create a remote repository of GitHub repository in my local
    repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Someone on the other side of the world can make changes to remote repository
    or it could be me. So, I don't want the changes to be automatically updated 
    into my local repo.I want to make sure what changes am I pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Cloning a git repository of one account on GitHub  to another account on GitHub.
	  I would use this if I find a repository on GitHub which serves the purpose I intended to.
	  So, it would be lot easier for me to directly use than to develop from scratch.
   Clone: Cloning is done to copy a git repository from GitHub to local computer.
	  This done if the files in the repository cannot be edited on GitHub.
   Branches: These are created on commits in scenarious like you want a different version 
	     or feature without disturbing the main working code.
	  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If any changes were introduced since then on remote, then while updating the local,
    we can make these changes to update on a separate branch(remote branch), see the diff
    in state of files on remote branch and master branch and merge them accordingly.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I have no idea. Most probably with something like gmail or so.
    I think collaborating on GitHub would be a lot easier than those
    I can think of.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
