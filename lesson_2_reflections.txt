What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A GIT Repository will be tied to the directory from where git init is run.
An empty git repository is initialized.It can contain the metadata of files in the present
directory and sub directories.It can keep track of all or a few of the files present in the
directory or sub-directories.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate level between working directory and repository.
It gives us the flexibility of choosing what files to be commited in a single 
commit.
